TODO list, in rough priority order

0. Any TODO tags or stubbed methods in the code
1. Move more code (Ex., this.dataWidth selection) from AddInstruction to the top-level Instruction constructor. The more we move into the upper levels, the less we have to duplicate for each Instruction instance
2. New abstract subclasses of Instruction:
  1. ThreeArgumentInstruction
  2. TwoArgumentInstruction
  3. OneArgumentInstruction
  4. ZeroArgumentInstruction
3. Move basically all the code fomr AddInstruction to the new ThreeArgumentInstruction. Have AddInstruction extend ThreeArgumentInstruction
4. Maybe add a new non-public constructor to Instruction which accepts an Opcode and shifts it into place, and is called by the non-abstract subclasses
5. More tests
6. More Instructions
